        Hello, my name is Andre Taylor II.  I have been interested in coding for a while now.
        I attempted to learn how to code using Youtube and cheaper online classes, before enrolling in the 
        University of California, Berkeley's class. Not having someone to talk to when i needed it, is what lead me to the Fullstack Developer class. 
        Even before trying to code on my own, I took a class on coding while in college. I was an Mechanical Engineering major and i took the class out of curiousity.
        I had a little bit of experience with Python, JavaScript, and HTML before i enrolled in the program. Now I have experience with Node, Express, MVC structure, and React.
